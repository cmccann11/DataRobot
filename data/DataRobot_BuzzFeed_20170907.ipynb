    "## Background \n",
    "BuzzFeed released a dataset and jupyter notebook recently that analyzed public flight data to identify potential spy planes.  This built on previous BuzzFeed stories on the same topic, which identified and verified spy planes. <br><br> Features from the 100 previously verified surveillance-planes were used as positive training examples in train.csv, as well as 500 randomly selected planes from a sample of 20,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "BuzzFeed conducted some very clever feature engineering (described below), and used random forests to train on the 600 plane training set using a train/validation split (due to time constraints no cross-validation was done), and then ran predictions on the remaining 19,799 aircraft in their sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "BuzzFeed identified 69 likely surveillance planes, and 19,091 normal aircraft flights.  \n",

    "BuzzFeed's data gathering and feature engineering were extremeley clever, and highlight a critical aspect of datas cience: developing new features from your dataset that enhance predictions.  In their article, they indicate a few areas of further study that they would like to do but were not able to.  In particular, \n",
    "\n",
    " * Use cross-validation on the training data set to get more generalizable predictions.  BuzzFeed fit their model on the entire training data set to set model parameters, and then ran predictions based on that fit.  While the bagging internal to Random Forests is a robust procedure against overfitting, we will use cross-validation.\n",
    " * Evaluate multiple models.  Random Forests is extremely powerful, but DataRobot will evaluate ~ 70 models to see which performs best.\n",

    "* Can we identify new planes that may have been missed? \n",
