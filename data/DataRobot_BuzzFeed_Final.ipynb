    "## Background \n",
    "BuzzFeed released a dataset and jupyter notebook recently that analyzed public flight data to identify potential spy planes.  This built on previous BuzzFeed stories on the same topic, which identified and verified spy planes. <br><br> Features from the 97 previously verified surveillance-planes were used as positive training examples in train.csv, as well as 500 randomly selected planes from a sample of 20,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "BuzzFeed conducted some very clever feature engineering (described below), and used random forests to train on the 597 plane training set using a train/validation split (due to time constraints no cross-validation was done), and then ran predictions on the remaining 19,799 aircraft in their sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "BuzzFeed identified 69 likely surveillance planes from their RandomForest prediction, and 19,091 normal aircraft flights.  \n",

    "# Objective\n",
    "BuzzFeed's data gathering and feature engineering were extremeley clever, and highlight a critical aspect of data science: developing new features from your dataset that enhance predictions. Feature engineering is both art and science, and the team at BuzzFeed did an incredible job deconstructing available flight data to create meaningful featres. In their article, they indicate a few areas of further study that they would like to do but were not able to.  In particular, \n",
    "\n",
    " * Use cross-validation on the training data set to get more generalizable predictions.  BuzzFeed fit their model on the entire training data set to set model parameters, and then ran predictions based on that fit.  While the bagging internal to Random Forests is a robust procedure against overfitting, we will use cross-validation.\n",
    " * Evaluate multiple models.  Random Forests is powerful tree-based algorithm that performs well in many settins, but DataRobot will evaluate dozens of models to see which performs best.\n",
    " \n",
    "**This is exactly where leveraging the power of automated machine learning with DataRobot becomes incredibly useful: Allowing Data Scientists to focus on feature engineering, interpretation and evaluation, and letting DataRobot's powerful automation evaluate dozens of models and preprocessing steps, all designed by some of the top Data Scientists in the world**\n",
    " \n",
    "In this notebook we will address the two items BuzzFeed wasn't able to get to, and in the process answer the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Can we build a more robust model using DataRobot that better predicts surveillance planes?*\n",
    "* *Can we identify new planes that may have been missed?* \n",

    "DataRobot allows us to run dozens of open source models with the press of a button, and as such the metric we use to compare them is important. Log-loss, or cross-entropy loss, is a good metric, as it compares the predicted probabilities to the class membership and penalizes miscalibrated probabilites. For binary classification, log-loss is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log [y_i \\log \\ p_i + (1-y_i) log (1-p_i)]    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\ N$ is the number of samples, $ \\ y_i$ is the correct class for an observation (either 0 or 1 for binary classification), and  $ \\ p_i $ is the predicted probability from the model.  The sum of these differences is the log-loss score.  A log-loss of zero is perfect: for all predicted classes 1, there is a probability of 1.  This, however, rarely happens in machine learning, unless there is leakage of the target in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In english this simply means that when your predictive model makes a prediction on new data, it returns a probability between 0 and 1.  If it was incredibly dialed in, it would make predictions very close to 1 for all positive class predictions, and very close to 0 for the other class. These models would have a very low log-loss score.  In reality, however, sometimes the best probability a model can produce for when the postiive class= 1 is, say, 0.6.  It's still a valid prediction, however there is more uncertainty in the prediction than in our previous example. Bottom-line, log-loss penalizes poor-probabilities and a lower score is better.\n",

    "DataRobot is going to evaluate lots of models using cross-validation on a consistent validation set to tune hyperparameters and ensure out of sample accuracy.  At the end, DataRobot will run a 5-folds cross validation on all of the data (minus holdout), and the best models will be comined to create ensembles to further increase accuracy.  \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our original questions were:\n",
    "* Can we build a more robust model using DataRobot that better predicts surveillance planes?\n",
    "    * We evaluated 41 models with multiple combinations of preprocessing and feature engineering, tuned hyperparameters using cross validation, evaluated model performance and selected our top performing models in a matter of minutes.\n",
    "    * Our best ensemble of 3 models had a cross-validation loss of 0.921, compared to our approximation of their RandomForest model's score of .1391, a 34% improvement\n",
    "* Can we identify new planes that may have been missed? \n",
    "    * Yes, we identified 58 different planes, with a few interesting ones that jumped out.  As well, we didn't falsely identify 15 of the 16 skydiving planes their model picked up.\n",
    "* Can we identify new important features in the model, and do our important features line-up with BuzzFeed's important features?\n",
    "    * Yes, we found a very strong signal with plane type, in conjunction with squawk_1 and steer_2, which were also in their top features.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the takeaway? First, your predictions are always only going to be as good as your training data, and we personally don't know the ins and outs of the 100 planes identified as surveillance beyond what was in the orignal BuzzFeed article.  That said, using only those 597 data points, we were able to identify planes with some very non-standard flight patterns using our model, specifically military training planes (Coastal Defense Inc), Search and Rescue planes (multiple Civil Air Patrol planes), 5 different municipal law enforcement planes, wildfire watch planes (Pacific Gas and Electric), a known DEA front (Chapparal Air),and a number of mapping services (which could be fronts- this came up in BuzzFeed's analysis.  That's pretty solid results out of 20,000 potential candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, this model's success was largely dependent on BuzzFeed's engineered features (though we would love to test the raw data in DataRobot!).  Data scientists can add break through value when they focus on feature engineering and applying domain knowledge, which is prevented when they spend hours manually evaluating models (which they were not able to.)  DataRobot doesn't automate data science, but it does automate a lot of the manual model building and evaluation that would have taken me literally weeks to do.  For reference, from the time I uploaded data into DataRobot, until I evaluated our final best model of the 41 attempted (including hyperparameter tuning), ** took about 10 minutes, with another 5 to compute predictions.** \n",
    "\n",
    "That is the power of automated machine learning.  DataRobot allows data scientists to iterate quickly, focus on feature engineering and model evaluation, and evaluate models from the best open source platforms that they may not be familiar with. \n",
